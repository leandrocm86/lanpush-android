# LANPUSH
### Share texts through LAN


LANPUSH is a utility to exchange text messages between devices in the same local network.<br>
**No internet required! No login!** Just send a message and all configured devices in the same LAN will read it.

#### Use cases:
- Share a link between PC and phone:
Tired of copying/pasting (and copying/pasting again) online notes to share links or texts between your devices?
LANPUSH allows you to quickly move from one device to another.
Once a message is sent, all PCs and Android phones on the same wifi will be able to show a notification with the new message, along with the option to copy it or browse it.

- Server automation:
With LANPUSH your server can easily send you warnings even when no internet is available.
You can also go the other way around, sending commands for the server to read and start your tasks.
Tired of going through SSH everytime just to start trivial jobs? Make your server act upon the messages it receives. You can configure lanpush to log messages on a predefined file, and also choose IPs and ports to listen to.

#### LANPUSH is available for PCs with Java (Windows/Linux/Mac) and phones with Android.
